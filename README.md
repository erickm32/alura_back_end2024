Project based on the Alura's Immersion program for back-end development.

Using node 22, express and mongodb. For now.

Based on the example database generated by mongodb atlas, setting up an API that's currently returning 10 movies on /movies or one movie based on its id on /movies/id.
Don't know if all the generated dbs will have the same data.

To be able to connect to mongodb cloud, get the connection example on your dashboard and save it on a mongo_access.txt file at the root of the project.
